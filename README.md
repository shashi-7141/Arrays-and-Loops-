# ðŸ“š Java Array Fundamentals

## âœ¨ Overview
This repository contains a simple Java console program (`ArrayBasics.java`) designed to illustrate the **fundamental concepts of arrays** in Java. It demonstrates both one-dimensional arrays and two-dimensional arrays (matrices), focusing on declaration, initialization, element access, and the use of the `java.util.Arrays` utility class.

This code is ideal for Java beginners studying basic data structures.

## ðŸš€ Key Learning Topics Covered

* **Declaration:** Creating `int[]` and `int[][]` variables.
* **Initialization:** Using both size allocation (`new int[N]`) and initializer lists (`{...}`).
* **Element Access:** Reading and writing array elements using indices (e.g., `arr[i]`).
* **Array Utility Class:** Using `Arrays.toString()` for 1D arrays and **`Arrays.deepToString()` for 2D arrays** for proper console output.
* **Sorting:** Applying the `Arrays.sort()` method to rearrange elements.

## ðŸ’» Setup and Usage

### **Prerequisites**
You need the **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your machine.

### **Steps to Run**

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the Java code above as `ArrayBasics.java` inside a directory named `src/`.
2.  **Navigate:** Open your command line/terminal and navigate to the root directory of this project (the folder containing the `src` folder).
3.  **Compile:** Compile the Java file:
    ```bash
    javac src/ArrayBasics.java
    ```
4.  **Execute:** Run the compiled class:
    ```bash
    java -cp src ArrayBasics
    ```

## ðŸ§ª Expected Output

The program will print a series of lines demonstrating how arrays change after different operations, with clear labels for each concept.
